A game I built back in high school following a youtube tutorial (link in the code)

Maybe one day I'll come back to fix it, one day, maybe tomorrow or tomorrow's tomorrow or yeah...... tommorrow's tommorow's tommorow
Wait, I can make this into a recursive function!

def tommorow():
  print(tommorow's, end="")
  return tommorow()

print("I'll do it " end="")
tommorow()
